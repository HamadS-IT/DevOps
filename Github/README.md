# What is Git and GitHub?

## Git
Git is a **version control system** used to track changes in code. It allows developers to save different versions of their project, work on multiple features at the same time, and collaborate without interfering with each other’s work. Git helps maintain a full history of the project and makes it easy to review or restore earlier versions.

## GitHub
GitHub is a **platform that hosts Git repositories online**. It allows developers to store their projects in the cloud, share them with others, and collaborate through features like pull requests, issues, discussions, and code reviews. While Git works on your computer, GitHub is a place to store and manage Git projects online.

# Git and GitHub Workflow

## 1. Start or Access a Project  
A developer begins a new project or downloads an existing one from GitHub.

## 2. Make Changes  
The developer updates files in the project—adding features, fixing bugs, or improving code.

## 3. Record a Snapshot  
Changes are collected and saved as a **commit**, which acts like a snapshot of the project at a specific moment.

## 4. Share the Changes  
The saved work is uploaded to GitHub so that others can see it and collaborate.

## 5. Use Branches  
Developers create branches to work on new ideas separately from the main project. This keeps experiments and features isolated until they are ready.

## 6. Create a Pull Request  
When a feature is complete, a pull request is created on GitHub. This is a request to merge the branch’s changes into the main project. Other team members can review and comment before approval.

## 7. Merge and Update  
After approval, the branch is merged into the main project. Developers then update their local copies to stay synced with the latest version.
